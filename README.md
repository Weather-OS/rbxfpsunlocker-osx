The first Roblox FPS unlocker for macOS. This script works  on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Setup

You may use the following command inside the Terminal application:
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanylow/rbxfpsunlocker-osx/script/install_fps_unlocker)"
```
After executing the script, you should see a confirmation that the unlocker was installed.

*Note: you must run the command again when Roblox updates.*

*Note: if you're using macOS Ventura or newer and your display doesn't support more than 60 Hz **you won't see the effect of this program** unless you use the Vulkan renderer. Please don't create issues asking about this.*
